# Gigabit Website Redirects

This is a simple node server that redirects the contents of the now shutdown [Hive Chattanooga](hivecha.org), [Hive Kansas](hivekc.org) and [Gigabit](blog.mozilla.org/gigabit) Wordpress websites to its new location on the [Learning site](learning.mozilla.org/gigabit)

All of the blog's contents from the three sites have been merged into the main [Learning Blog](learning.mozilla.org/blog) and due to duplication of posts and conflicts in the blog post slugs across the three blogs, this server manually handles those redirects as "special case redirects" to their appropriate home on the Learning Blog.
